# Getting Started Plugins/Apps for Liferay Portal 6.2

The [liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2-ce-ga4](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lportal/files/Liferay%20Portal/6.2.3%20GA4/liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2-ce-ga4-20150416163831865.zip/download), which contains sample Liferay plugins code for my learning and R&D purpose. These plugins are tried primarily compatible with [Liferay Portal CE 6.2 GA4](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lportal/files/Liferay%20Portal/6.2.3%20GA4/).

For more information about Liferay Plugins SDK, see its original [README file](https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-Liferay/gs-plugins-sdk-6.2-ce-ga4/blob/master/README.markdown.original).

## Setup Instructions

One should be able to import these plugin projects in Eclipse IDE: File -> Import -> Liferay.

To build plugins using the Liferay Plugins SDK tasks, one has to create "build.username.properties" file.

For detailed Liferay environment setup steps, see [Liferay Portal 6.2 - Getting Started Guide - Development Setup using Eclipse Kepler](http://tirthalpatel.blogspot.in/2014/02/liferay-portal-6.2-development-setup-guide.html) blog.

## Sample code as per Liferay Developer Documentation and Liferay in Action Book (for Liferay Portal 6.2.0 version)

The sample Liferay tutorials for my own reference, which I created by following [Liferay Documentation](https://dev.liferay.com/develop). All plugin project names has prefix "ldoc-*".

The [source code](https://manning-content.s3.amazonaws.com/download/4/19a995e-a6e5-4e76-b1cd-efa6545053a5/plugins-lia.zip) of [Liferay in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/liferay-in-action) book is primarily designed for Liferay Portal 6.0.6 and provides guidance of Liferay 6.1.
Obviously these plugins are not compatible with Liferay 6.2. So I had migrated "Liferay in Action" book's below plugins to Liferay 6.2.0 version by adding prefix "lia-*".
I thought to make those also public for community reference, in case anyone wants to try those with Liferay 6.2.0 while reading "Liferay in Action" book.

To understand code, see respective section of Liferay Documentation or Liferay in Action Book.

## TODO --- Add example plugins/apps code

Oops, I got to do some urgent work, so will add my learning code to repository later on.
